### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am full stack dev looking to solve real world problems. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others as publicly as possible.
I am specialist in VUE JS, Javascript is growing much more that we could breath ðŸ˜„, but this language is my favourite to keep learning and innovating in some projects. So you can ask me about BLOCKCHAIN and you can see more in my BLOG [NOTICIA DE BITCOIN](https://noticiadebitcoin.blogspot.com), and I continue searching for solutions to my country, it means ( BRAZIL ) ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
